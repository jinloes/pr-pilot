# Claude PR Reviews — IntelliJ Plugin

IntelliJ plugin that lists GitHub Pull Requests and generates AI-powered code reviews using the local `claude` CLI.

> **CLAUDE.md maintenance rule:** This file must be updated as part of every coding task. Before finishing any task:
> - Add new features to the "Major features" list
> - Update "Project layout" when files are added or renamed
> - Update "Key design decisions" when architectural choices change
> - Update "Settings persistence" when new settings are added
> - Update "Local data files" when new persistent files are introduced

---

## Major features

- **PR browser** — lists open PRs filtered by Assigned / Review Requested / Created by me, with an optional per-repo scope selector
- **AI code review** — sends the PR diff to the local `claude` CLI and produces a summary, inline line comments categorised by type (issue / suggestion / praise / note), and a verdict (Approve / Request Changes / Comment); the prompt automatically includes project conventions (CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, or a style sample) and enforces a 100% branch-coverage check on non-trivial changes
- **Syntax-highlighted diff viewer** — colour-coded add/del lines with line numbers in the gutter and full semantic token highlighting for Java, Python, Go, Kotlin, JavaScript/JSX, TypeScript/TSX, Rust, Bash, and Proto
- **GitHub-backed draft reviews** — saves and loads a pending review on GitHub (summary, verdict, inline comments); automatically detects an existing pending review when a PR is selected
- **Draft submit** — publishes the pending review with a chosen event (Approve / Request Changes / Comment) and an optional top-level comment entered in the submit dialog
- **Load Draft dialog** — lists previously saved drafts from a local index so you can reload any saved PR
- **Comment editing** — inline comment cards are editable in-place; dismissing a card removes it from the review so it is excluded from the next save
- **Comment navigation** — ▲/▼ buttons scroll to each comment in document order; the count label updates as cards are dismissed
- **Chat panel** — collapsible follow-up chat below the diff; each message is sent with the PR metadata, summary, comments, and verdict as automatic context
- **Selection context** — selecting text in the diff, or clicking a line-number in the gutter, prepends a quoted context block to the next chat message
- **Right-click "Ask Claude" menu** — right-clicking the diff offers *Explain this line*, *Explain selection*, and *Summarize this file* actions; these use a lightweight focused prompt (`chatFocused()`) that wraps only the selected code snippet in `<code_context>` tags without injecting the full PR comment list
- **Add-comment button** — hovering over any diff line reveals a "+" button that inserts a new blank comment card at that line for immediate typing
- **Markdown rendering** — Claude responses render fenced code blocks with syntax highlighting, bold/italic, inline code, numbered/bullet lists, and headers
- **PR notifications** — optional background polling fires IDE balloon notifications for new review-requested PRs and/or new PRs on starred repos (configurable interval, default 5 min)
- **Verify pattern in repo** — right-clicking a comment card → "Verify pattern in repo" asks Claude to check whether the flagged pattern is an established convention in the repo; findings are saved to a per-repo knowledge file and injected into future review prompts so verified patterns are not re-flagged
- **PR summary sidebar** — the AI-generated summary is shown in a right-side panel (always visible alongside the diff); sections: Overview, Key Changes, Risk Areas
- **Width-constrained comment cards** — comment cards cap their width to match the diff's longest line and align with the diff gutter
- **Auto-cleanup of stale drafts** — when a merged PR is selected, the plugin automatically deletes its pending GitHub draft and removes it from the local index
- **Diff prefetch on PR selection** — when a PR is selected, `loadDraftFromGitHub()` fetches the diff in the background so `generateReview()` can skip the network round-trip; prefetch failure is non-fatal and generateReview() re-fetches as a fallback
- **Configurable review model** — a "Review model" combo in Settings lets the user pick between the CLI default, Haiku 4.5, Sonnet 4.6, or Opus 4.7; the selected model is passed as `--model <id>` to the `claude` CLI during reviews
- **Theme-aware color palette** — `ThemeColors` detects the IDE light/dark theme via Panel.background luminance and provides the matching GitHub-inspired palette to all UI classes (ReviewPanel, ChatPanel, CommentCard)
- **Workflow action strip** — Generate Review, Save Draft, and Submit ▶ are grouped together at the bottom of the review pane in task order; "Saved Drafts" is a dedicated toolbar button separate from the filter combo

## Key design decisions

### ThemeColors — centralized theme-aware palette
`ThemeColors` is a package-private class in `com.jinloes.claudereviews.ui` that initializes all color constants in a static block at class-load time. It detects the IDE light/dark theme by reading `UIManager.getColor("Panel.background")` and computing the luminance (`0.299R + 0.587G + 0.114B`): luminance < 0.5 → dark (GitHub dark-mode palette), ≥ 0.5 → light (GitHub light-mode palette). All three consumer classes (`ReviewPanel`, `ChatPanel`, `CommentCard`) reference `ThemeColors.*` instead of declaring their own color constants. Semantic accent colors (`ACCENT_BLUE`, `ACCENT_GREEN`, `ERROR_FG`) are identical in both themes.

### Workflow strip — Generate / Save / Submit in task order
The three primary review workflow actions (`generateButton`, `saveDraftButton`, `submitButton`) are grouped left-to-right in the `reviewControls` bottom bar using a `BorderLayout` wrapper: a `FlowLayout` panel (`WEST`) holds the buttons, and `statusLabel` fills `CENTER`. The "Saved Drafts" view is accessed via a dedicated toolbar button rather than a filter-combo entry; the boolean field `showingDrafts` tracks whether the PR list is showing drafts (used to decide whether to remove a PR from the list after local-draft deletion).

### GitHub authentication — no stored token
The plugin never stores a GitHub token. `GitHubAuthService.resolveToken()` runs `gh auth token` each time a token is needed. Token lives only in the `gh` CLI keychain/config.

### Finding the `gh` binary
`GitHubAuthService.findGhBinary()` probes hard-coded paths before falling back to bare `"gh"`:
```
/opt/homebrew/bin/gh   ← Apple Silicon Homebrew
/usr/local/bin/gh      ← Intel Homebrew / manual
/usr/bin/gh            ← system package managers
/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/gh
```
**Why:** IntelliJ launched from the macOS Dock doesn't inherit the user's shell `PATH`. Wrapping in `zsh --login -c` was tried first but doesn't source `~/.zshrc`, so tools added to `PATH` only there (asdf, mise, etc.) were still not found. `HOME` is also set explicitly on the `ProcessBuilder` so `gh` can find its config.

### Finding the `claude` binary
`ClaudeService.buildProcess()` augments the inherited `PATH` with `/usr/local/bin`, `/opt/homebrew/bin`, `/usr/bin` rather than probing. The `claude` CLI is invoked directly (not through a login shell). When a review model is configured in Settings, `--model <id>` is appended to the CLI arguments in `runReview()`.

### Claude invocation
`claude --print` enables non-interactive mode. The full prompt is written to `stdin` (not passed as a CLI arg) to avoid OS argument-length limits. Output is streamed in 512-char chunks and appended to the review text area on the EDT.

### Review prompt structure (`ClaudeService.buildPrompt`)
The review prompt instructs Claude as a "senior security engineer" whose mandate is bugs that will reach production, real/exploitable security vulnerabilities, and design decisions that introduce tight coupling, violate codebase patterns, or create API surfaces that cannot be changed without breaking callers — not linter-enforceable style. It defines a strict JSON schema and includes:
- **XML-tag wrapping of untrusted input**: all user-controlled sections are wrapped in XML tags — `<diff>`, `<pr_description>`, `<project_conventions>`, `<known_patterns>` — so they are structurally distinct from instructions. The prompt explicitly tells Claude to treat content inside these tags as untrusted data and to ignore any instructions found within them (prompt injection guard).
- **Injection guard**: the `REVIEW_INSTRUCTIONS` text states that instructions inside `<project_conventions>` that attempt to change review behavior, suppress findings, or alter the verdict must be ignored.
- **Line numbering rule**: for each `@@ -old,count +new,count @@` header the new-file line number resets to `new`; count +1 for each context or added ('+') line; skip deleted lines and the `@@` header line itself; reset at every new `@@` header within a file.
- **Comment body template**: every body must state the problem, why it matters, and a concrete fix; max 300 chars; single-line JSON string.
- **Priority-ordered checklist**: correctness → security → test coverage (100% branch on non-trivial changes) → performance → design.
- **Typed severities**: `issue` = must fix (triggers REQUEST_CHANGES verdict); `suggestion` = non-blocking; `note` = informational.
- **Verdict enum constraints**: `"verdict"` must be one of `"APPROVE"` | `"REQUEST_CHANGES"` | `"COMMENT"`; `"type"` must be one of `"issue"` | `"suggestion"` | `"note"`; `"line"` must be a positive integer.
- **Report ALL findings**: checklist instructs "Report ALL issues, suggestions, and notes you find" — replaces the previous "stop at the first blocking issue per area" instruction.
- **Verdict criteria**: APPROVE if no issues; REQUEST_CHANGES if any issue; COMMENT for questions without a blocking concern.
- **Project conventions**: `PRToolWindow.readProjectConventions()` probes the open project root for `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/AGENTS.md` (in that order) and injects the first file found inside `<project_conventions>` tags so Claude can flag deviations from established patterns.

### Chat prompt structure (`ClaudeService.buildChatPrompt` / `buildFocusedChatPrompt`)
Two distinct chat prompt paths exist:
- **`buildChatPrompt(prContext, history, userMessage)`** — general follow-up chat; includes the full PR review context (summary, comments, verdict) before history, wraps each history turn in `<turn role="user">` / `<turn role="assistant">` tags, and wraps the user message in `<user_message>` tags. Used by `ChatPanel.sendMessage()`.
- **`buildFocusedChatPrompt(focusedContext, question)`** — lightweight prompt for focused code questions (right-click "Explain this line", "Explain selection", "Summarize this file", and "Verify pattern in repo"). Wraps the code snippet in `<code_context>` tags and the question in `<user_message>` tags. Does NOT include the full PR comment list. Called by `ClaudeService.chatFocused()`, which is in turn called by `ChatPanel.askFocused()`.

### Diff truncation
`GitHubService.getPRDiff()` truncates diffs to 80 KB (`MAX_DIFF_BYTES = 80_000`) to stay within reasonable context limits.

### Syntax highlighting — tree-sitter hunk-level parsing
`TreeSitterHighlighter.colorHunk(lines, extension)` is the sole highlighting entry point. `ReviewPanel.precomputeSpans()` groups diff lines into hunks (split at `DiffLine.hunkStart()` boundaries) and calls `DiffHighlighter.colorHunk()`, which delegates to `TreeSitterHighlighter`. The entire hunk is joined with `\n` and fed to the tree-sitter parser as one string so multi-line constructs (Javadoc, block comments, text blocks) resolve correctly. Captures are priority-sorted by `patternIndex` ascending (more specific patterns overwrite general ones) and painted into a `charColors[]` array, which is then merged into per-line `Span` lists. Languages without a grammar (or parse failures) return single `FG_COLOR` spans.

`TreeSitterHighlighter` initialises lazily on first call, catching `UnsatisfiedLinkError` so any native-library failure degrades gracefully. Highlight queries live in `src/main/resources/highlights/` (adapted from nvim-treesitter).

### Syntax highlighting — predicate evaluation
nvim-treesitter query files use `#lua-match?`, `#eq?`, `#any-of?`, and `#match?` predicates to narrow general captures (e.g. `(identifier) @type` only for uppercase identifiers). `TreeSitterHighlighter.parsePredicates` reads `TSQueryPredicateStep[]` arrays from `TSQuery.getPredicateForPattern` and parses them into `QueryPredicate` records. During match iteration, predicates are evaluated via `evaluatePredicates`; matches that fail a predicate are skipped entirely. Lua character-class escapes (`%d`, `%u`, `%l`, `%a`, etc.) are converted to Java regex via `luaPatternToJava` and matched with `Matcher.find()` (partial matching, consistent with Lua `string.match` semantics).

### Syntax highlighting — in-quote suppression
`buildSpans` applies two layers of capture suppression to prevent grammar error-recovery from mis-coloring tokens:

1. **In-quote map** — `buildInQuoteMap(source)` precomputes a boolean array where `true` marks char positions strictly inside `"..."` pairs. Captures whose start is inside a quoted region are dropped. This handles `rpc` inside a quoted proto import path like `"proto/.../grpc/..."`.

2. **Quote-char guard** — For `@string` captures specifically, `isQuoteChar(source.charAt(start))` verifies the captured text starts with a quote character (`"`, `'`, `` ` ``). This prevents the proto grammar's `(string)` named node from coloring the bare `string` scalar-type keyword blue when it appears in field declarations like `optional string nameSubstring`.

3. **Word-boundary guard** — For keyword-colored captures, `isWordChar` checks verify the character before the start and after the end of the capture are not word characters (`[a-zA-Z0-9_]`). If they are, the token is a substring of a larger identifier and is suppressed. This handles `rpc` inside `grpc` in unquoted package-style type references like `proto.com.linkedin.gagarin.grpc.api.crm.Foo`.

All three checks are language-agnostic and run in `buildSpans` after `captureColor` returns a non-null color.

### Syntax highlighting — capture-name to colour mapping
`TreeSitterHighlighter.captureColor` maps tree-sitter capture names to hardcoded GitHub dark-mode colours from `@primer/primitives` (dark scale). Unknown capture names (e.g. `@variable`, `@operator`, `@spell`) return `null` and are skipped — this prevents `@spell` annotations on comment nodes from overwriting the `@comment` colour, and means call sites (`@function.call`) are rendered in plain `FG_COLOR` just like on GitHub (only declarations get colour). No IntelliJ `EditorColorsScheme` or `DefaultLanguageHighlighterColors` is involved in colour resolution.

### Syntax highlighting — colour palette
All token colours are hardcoded GitHub dark mode values from `@primer/primitives` (dark scale) — no IntelliJ colour scheme involvement: `#ff7b72` (scale.red[3]) keywords; `#ffa657` (scale.orange[2]) declarations; `#79c0ff` (scale.blue[2]) constants/numbers/builtins; `#a5d6ff` (scale.blue[1]) strings; `#8b949e` (scale.gray[3]) comments; `#e6edf3` default foreground for everything else.

### GitHub Enterprise
If `githubBaseUrl` is not `https://github.com`, the REST API base is derived as `<base>/api/v3` and `gh auth token --hostname <host>` is used.

### GitHubService — application-level singleton
`GitHubService` is registered as an IntelliJ application-level `@Service` in `plugin.xml` and retrieved via `GitHubService.getInstance()`. This prevents duplicate instances and makes it injectable by the IntelliJ platform.

### GitHub API responses — typed Jackson DTO records
All GitHub API responses are parsed via typed Jackson DTO records declared as package-accessible inner types of `GitHubService` (`SearchResult`, `PrItem`, `GhUser`, `StarredRepo`, `GhReview`, `GhReviewComment`, `PrDetail`, `HeadRef`). Raw `JsonNode` tree-model parsing in method bodies has been eliminated, preventing `ClassCastException` bugs on error/rate-limit responses that return an object rather than an array.

### HTTP request timeouts
All `HttpRequest.newBuilder()` calls in `GitHubService` include `.timeout(Duration.ofSeconds(30))` and in `GitHubAuthService` include `.timeout(Duration.ofSeconds(15))` to prevent indefinite hangs on unresponsive GitHub API endpoints.

### PatternKnowledgeBase filename separator
`PatternKnowledgeBase.fileFor()` uses `%` as the owner/repo filename separator (e.g. `owner%repo.md`). The `%` character cannot appear in GitHub owner or repo names, making the separator unambiguous even when owner or repo names contain underscores.

### JSON serialization — Jackson with Optional accessors
All JSON parsing and serialization uses `com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper`. `JsonNode`/`ArrayNode`/`ObjectNode` replace Gson's `JsonElement`/`JsonArray`/`JsonObject`. `TypeReference<T>` replaces Gson's `TypeToken<T>` for generic deserialization. Pretty-printing uses `MAPPER.enable(SerializationFeature.INDENT_OUTPUT)`.

Stream-event DTOs (`StreamEvent`, `EventMessage`, `ContentBlock`) use `@Data @Getter(AccessLevel.NONE)` — Lombok generates setters that Jackson uses for deserialization, and all field accessors are written manually. Nullable fields expose `Optional<T>` getters (`Optional.ofNullable(field)`) while non-nullable fields return their type directly.

### Threading model
Background I/O uses `ApplicationManager.getApplication().executeOnPooledThread()`. All UI updates go through `ApplicationManager.getApplication().invokeLater()` (EDT). No raw `Thread` creation. Notification polling uses `AppExecutorUtil.getAppScheduledExecutorService()`.

### GitHub draft review round-trip fidelity
GitHub's review comment API returns `line: null` for comments that become outdated when the PR is updated. To preserve line numbers across save/load cycles, `GitHubService.encodeBody()` embeds all comments as a compact JSON array inside an HTML comment in the review body:
```
<!-- claude-comments: [{"f":"src/Foo.java","l":42,"t":"issue","b":"body text"},...] -->
```
`decodeReview()` reads from this block first (reliable). If the block is absent (old draft), it falls back to parsing the GitHub API comment list with `original_line` as a secondary fallback.

### Draft review creation
Creating a GitHub pending (draft) review requires omitting the `event` field entirely from the POST payload. Setting `event: "PENDING"` is invalid and causes a 422. If inline comments cause a 422 (invalid path/line for that commit), `saveDraftReview` calls `tryCommentsIndividually` to probe each comment one at a time (creates a temp single-comment review, deletes it immediately, marks valid). Only the valid subset is included in the final review. `SaveDraftResult` carries a `commentsDropped` flag so `PRToolWindow.saveDraft()` can show a warning in the status bar when any comments were dropped.

`saveDraftReview` deletes any existing PENDING review before creating the new one, but wraps the delete in a `try/catch(IOException)` — GitHub's state transition from PENDING → APPROVED is asynchronous, so `getPendingReviewId` can briefly return the just-submitted review's ID; attempting to delete it returns a 422 (not deletable). Swallowing that error and proceeding to create the new draft is correct.

### Post-submit UI reset
After `submitDraftReview()` succeeds, `PRToolWindow` clears `lastResult`, resets the review panel to a placeholder ("Review submitted — Generate a new review to start over"), and resets the summary sidebar. This prevents the submitted review's verdict from persisting on screen and ensures `saveDraft()` cannot inadvertently save stale data (its `lastResult == null` guard will short-circuit).

### Duplicate comment prevention
Two guards prevent inline comments from appearing twice on GitHub:
1. **Deduplication at save time** — `saveDraftReview()` tracks `(file, line, body)` triples in a `LinkedHashSet` and skips duplicates. Defends against Claude returning the same comment twice while still allowing distinct comments on the same line.
2. **Submit locks the save button** — `PRToolWindow.submitDraftReview()` disables `saveDraftButton` immediately (alongside `submitButton`) before the background HTTP call. This closes a race where the user could click "Save Draft" while a submit was in flight, causing a new pending draft to be created after the submitted review was no longer PENDING, and then submitted a second time.

### Selection context persistence
`ReviewPanel.getSelectedText()` only updates `lastKnownSelection` when there is an active non-empty selection — it never clears it on focus loss. This lets the selection survive when the user clicks into the chat input. `clearSelection()` resets it explicitly on new PR load.

### Comment dismissal
`CommentCard` accepts a `Consumer<CommentCard> onDismiss` callback. When the × button is clicked, `ReviewPanel.onCardDismissed()` removes the card from `commentCards`, removes the `LineComment` from `result.getLineComments()` (always a mutable `ArrayList`), clamps `currentCommentIndex`, and fires the `onCommentRemoved` runnable so `PRToolWindow` can refresh the nav count.

### Diff prefetch on PR selection
`loadDraftFromGitHub()` fetches the diff immediately after confirming the PR is not merged, storing it in `prefetchedDiff` / `prefetchedPR` volatile fields (set on the EDT inside `runOnEdt`). When `generateReview()` runs, it reads `prefetchedDiff` into a local variable and checks `cachedPR == pr` (identity comparison, safe because `pr` is the same object from the list model) before reusing it; after consuming the cache it nulls both fields. A failed prefetch stores `null` (non-fatal), and `generateReview()` falls back to a fresh HTTP call. This eliminates the 1–3 s diff fetch latency that otherwise precedes the Claude invocation.

## Testing conventions

**Rule: every code change must include tests for any new or modified non-UI logic. Pure-Java service and utility code must have 100% branch coverage. Tests must be written as part of the same task — never deferred to a follow-up.**

**Checklist — before marking any coding task complete:**
1. Identify every new or modified non-UI method (service, utility, model, static helper).
2. Widen any `private` method that needs test access to package-private (no `public`).
3. Write tests covering every branch: happy path, edge cases, and error paths.
4. Run `./gradlew unitTest` and confirm all tests pass.

- Run tests with `./gradlew unitTest`
- Tests live under `src/test/java/com/jinloes/claudereviews/` mirroring the main source tree.
- Use **JUnit 5** (`@Test`, `@Nested`, `@TempDir`) and **AssertJ** for assertions.
- Group related tests inside `@Nested` inner classes named after the method or scenario (e.g., `@Nested class InlineHtml`, `@Nested class RoundTrip`).
- Methods that need to be callable from tests are widened to package-private (drop `private`); never make them `public` just for tests.
- Tests must not depend on IntelliJ platform classes (`ApplicationManager`, `JBLabel`, etc.) — pure-Java logic only.
- UI classes (anything extending `JPanel`, `JComponent`, etc.) are excluded from the coverage requirement as they require a display to render.
- File-based classes (`PendingReviewIndex`, `SeenPRSet`, `PatternKnowledgeBase`) use `@TempDir` for isolation — never write to `~/.claude-reviews` in tests.
- `DiffHighlighter.htmlEscape` is a **token renderer** that converts spaces to `&nbsp;` — test inputs that contain spaces will have them replaced.

## Build

```bash
./gradlew buildPlugin          # produces build/distributions/*.zip
./gradlew runIde               # launches a sandboxed IntelliJ with the plugin loaded
./gradlew spotlessApply        # format all Java sources (runs automatically via Claude Code hook)
./gradlew spotlessCheck        # verify formatting without modifying files (useful in CI)
```

- Java 17, IntelliJ platform `2024.1` (IC), Gradle IntelliJ plugin `2.13.1`
- `sinceBuild = 253`, `untilBuild = 253.*`
- No bundled plugin dependencies — syntax highlighting is handled entirely by tree-sitter, so the plugin works in any IntelliJ-based IDE without requiring `com.intellij.java`
- Runtime dependencies: `com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind:2.17.1`, `org.commonmark:commonmark:0.22.0`, `org.apache.commons:commons-lang3:3.17.0`, `org.apache.commons:commons-text:1.12.0`, `org.apache.commons:commons-collections4:4.4`, `commons-io:commons-io:2.16.1`, `io.github.bonede:tree-sitter:0.26.3`, `io.github.bonede:tree-sitter-java:0.23.5`, `io.github.bonede:tree-sitter-proto:main-a` (native libs bundled for macOS/Linux/Windows on x86_64 + aarch64)
- **Apache Commons preference**: use `CollectionUtils.isEmpty` (collections4), `StringUtils.isNotBlank` / `StringUtils.defaultString` (lang3), `Strings.CS.removeStart` / `Strings.CS.removeEnd` (lang3 3.17+), and `StringEscapeUtils.escapeHtml4` (commons-text) in preference to hand-rolled null/empty/prefix checks
- Lombok is `compileOnly` (annotation processing only, not shipped); use `@Slf4j` for logging — Lombok generates the `log` field automatically, no manual `Logger` declaration needed
- **Code style**: Spotless + Google Java Format AOSP variant (4-space indent, 100-col limit). A `Stop` hook in `.claude/settings.json` runs `./gradlew spotlessApply` automatically at the end of every Claude response (applies to all contributors).
- **Google Java Style Guide compliance** (https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html): no FQNs in method bodies (always add an import), descriptive local variable names (not `hl`, `attrs`), static imports before non-static, braces on all blocks.
- **Commenting policy**: add inline comments only where the *why* is non-obvious. Good candidates: intentionally swallowed exceptions (explain what non-fatal condition is expected), non-obvious OS/platform workarounds (e.g. IntelliJ Dock launch not inheriting PATH), magic error codes or string sentinels that require domain knowledge to decode (e.g. POSIX `error=2` = ENOENT), and deliberate algorithmic choices that a reader might be tempted to "fix" (e.g. a small read buffer to enable incremental streaming). Do not comment self-evident code or restate what the method name already says.
- **Commit conventions**: do not include a `Co-Authored-By` trailer in commit messages.

---

## Settings persistence

`PluginSettings` is an `@State` application-level service persisted to `claudeReviews.xml`. It stores:
- `githubBaseUrl` (default `https://github.com`)
- `githubUsername` (display cache only — re-fetched on demand)
- `notificationsEnabled` (default `false`)
- `notifyReviewRequested` (default `true`)
- `notifyStarredRepos` (default `false`)
- `notificationPollMinutes` (default `5`)
- `reviewModel` (default `""` — uses the CLI default; non-empty values are passed as `--model <id>` to `claude`)

No API keys or tokens are ever written to disk.
